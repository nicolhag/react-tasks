# Intro

Through these exercises you will learn how to create your very own React application ðŸŽ‰Luckily for us, React has very useful and up-to-date documentation at [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). Even experienced React-developers confer with this documentation weekly, so you should try it out as well; you are encouraged to use the docs actively throughout solving the assignments that follows. Still, remember to ask group tutors and co-students as well. We are here to help :\)

## About the tasks at hand

For simplicity's sake, and to reduce the cognitive load of setting up a full environment ourselves, we have chosen to put the the assignments up on **codesandbox.io**. The site creates an in-browser React-environment for us, letting us to skip the setup-part \(for now\), as well as giving us code hints and a useful developer environment for our purposes. 

## The structure of this Gitbook

Each chapter will contain at least two elements:

* Explanation of the code given
* A link to an assignment at CodeSandbox, where precode is given

## Working on the examples locally on your machine

All of the example React projects from CodeSandbox can be setup locally on your machine. Follow the instructions below:   
- [Install Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
- Click the "Download" button inside your CodeSandbox application  
- Navigate to the folder in the terminal and run `npm install` , followed by `npm start`.   
- Go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser, and your site should appear!
