# Intro

Through these exercises you will learn how to create your very own React application ðŸŽ‰Luckily for us, React has very useful and up-to-date documentation at [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). Even experienced React-developers confer with this documentation weekly, so you should try it out as well; you are encouraged to use the docs actively throughout solving the assignments that follows. But still, remember to ask group tutors and co-students as well. We are here to help :\)

## About the tasks at hand

For simplicity's sake, we have chosen to put the the assignments up on [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io). The site creates an in-browser React-environment for us, letting us to skip the setup-part \(for now\), as well as giving us code hints and a useful developer environment for our purposes. 

## The structure of this Gitbook

Each chapter will contain at least two elements:

* A link to an assignment at CodeSandbox, where precode is given
* Explanation of the code given
