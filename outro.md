# Outro

If you think that these assignments have been a mouthful, don't worry! If you would understand JSX, passing props, class components and component state, you can pretty much build whatever with React. 

We hope that you've had a great time, and that you can use this in spare-time projects, at school or at work ðŸŽ‰

If you would like to create your own React application from scratch, we highly recommend following the Create React App guide at [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Good luck!
