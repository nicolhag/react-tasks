# Finally, off to production!

## The very first React app

### Step 1: Install Node and Npm

Follow the instructions for installing Node \(containing the package manager npm\) on the operating system of your preference at [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Step 2: Clone this repo

### Step 3: Check out the precode

Your application will live in the folder labeled my-first-react-app. Enter the folder by typing:

```bash
cd my-first-react-app
```

Secondly, run

```bash
npm start
```

to fire up the local server instance. At this point, your first React app should be running at `http://localhost:3000/`. Awesome!

Try to change the content of the `<h1>` tag in the `App.js` file. If you have the browser window open at the same time, you will notice that the site is automatically updated with the new content. This is called _hot reloading_, and is quite handy while developing.
