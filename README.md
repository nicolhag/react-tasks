# Your very first first React Application!

Through these exercises you will learn how to create your very own React applicationðŸŽ‰ Luckily for us, React has very useful and up-to-date documentation at [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html). Even experienced React-developers confer with this documentation weekly, so you should try it out as well; you are encouraged to use the docs actively throughout solving the assignments that follows. But still, remember to ask group tutors and co-students as well. We are here to help :)

## About the tasks at hand

For simplicity's sake, we have chosen to put the the assignments up on [codesandbox.io](codesandbox.io). The site creates an in-browser React-environment for us, letting us to skip the setup-part (for now), as well as giving us code hints and a useful developer environment for our purposes. In the last assignment, you will be able to quite easily make the setup yourself.  

## The very first React app






### Step 1: Install Node and Npm

Follow the instructions for installing Node (containing the package manager npm) on the operating system of your preference at https://nodejs.org/en/.

### Step 2: Clone this repo

### Step 3: Check out the precode

Your application will live in the folder labeled my-first-react-app. Enter the folder by typing:

```bash
cd my-first-react-app
```

Secondly, run

```bash
npm start
```

to fire up the local server instance. At this point, your first React app should be running at `http://localhost:3000/`. Awesome!

Try to change the content of the `<h1>` tag in the `App.js` file. If you have the browser window open at the same time, you will notice that the site is automatically updated with the new content. This is called *hot reloading*, and is quite handy while developing.
