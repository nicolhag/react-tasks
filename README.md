# Welcome to a React workshop!

For this workshop, we will gather everything you need in this Gitbook; introduction to tasks, assignments and useful links. The content can be found at the table of contents in the left section of this page, or simply by following the links in the bottom of the pages. 

Also, feel free to confer with the slides from the [lecture](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN5320/h18/slides/in5320-4-react.pdf), or the [code](https://github.com/selbekk/react-todo-livecoded) from the live coding session of a Todo application.
